#Problem 1
#05 October 2001

#If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

#Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

# evalute that the following things are true to n:
# that it is a multiple of 3 that is less than 1000
# that it is divisible by 3 with a reminder
# if all those are true, add result of muliplication to the list

# evaluate that the following is true to a n:
# it is a multiple of 5 that is less than 1000
# if so add that result to the list

# add 1 to n
# ELSE sum the list of values

sum_this = []
multiple = 1
evaluated = 0

print 3 * multiple < 1000
evaluated = 3 * multiple

print evaluated
