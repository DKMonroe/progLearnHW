##Where I Keep My Homework from Learning to Program
I'm using GitHub to keep my files up-to-date across all my computers. That way I can do my homework no matter where I am, or what I'm doing. Also, it keeps me from using the excuse, "Well, my work is on my other computer." Dammit internets for being so awesome. Now I can't procrastinate.
